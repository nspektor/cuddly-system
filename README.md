Creating a visual display with multiple moving objects

* DVD Logos can be created can be created with a selected velocity and size.
* Their respective data is stored within a table for the user to see.
* DVD Logos run independently of each other.
* DVD Logos can be selected for deletion without affecting the others.

## Future Additions
* Make DVD Logos collide with each other
* Offer different image types
* Make it look prettier
